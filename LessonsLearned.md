## Lessons Learned

From Amanda at Griffith Uni

- Sometimes people have trouble identifying us as a group at the cafe. We use a poster but I'm considering investing in a flag. 
- We tried doing short 10min classes in the first few hacky hours, however they did not work at all. People became dissengaged very quickly. We found keeping the classes and the hacky hours separate best.
- Rubber Ducky theory : Sometimes when clients are getting tangled up in their code/problems, we tell them to talk to a 'rubber ducky' or an inanimate object and walk through their problems (I also offer them to email me). I tell them to go through each step to where they got to and each issue or error message they got. This helps them sometimes to solve it themselves as they haven't taken a step back and got lost in the rabbit hole of solutions.
