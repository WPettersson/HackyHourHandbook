## Lessons Learned

From Amanda at Griffith Uni

- Sometimes people have trouble identifying us as a group at the cafe. We use a poster but I'm considering investing in a flag. 
- We tried doing short 10min classes in the first few hacky hours, however they did not work at all. People became dissengaged very quickly. We found keeping the classes and the hacky hours separate best.
