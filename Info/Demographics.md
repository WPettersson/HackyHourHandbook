We found that it was hard to crack a lot of silos hidden in our institutes. While we advertised widely, it was worth going into HDR rooms that were likely to be doing R or Python (usually your data scientists) and talking to them.

The areas of research that you will find get the most attendance from Hacky Hours:
- Environment
- Bioinformatics
- Chemoinformatics
- Allied Health
- Medical
- Psychology
- Social Marketing

Please do add other areas to target. 
Otherwise, there have been studies such as https://zenodo.org/record/14809#.WevWzZ8xDCJ
