## Starting a Hacky Hour


## People to have in your toolbox
When starting a Hacky Hour, there are a number of people in your institute that you should contact/invite

|People|Why|
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|HPC team| Many of your inquiries are going to be people trying to use HPC the first time,getting needed libraries on the HPC or not understanding the errors|
|Someone who can program in R or Python| Most researchers who are learning to code will be using these two. |
|Your Librarians /Data librarians/Digital Capability officers| The library is the first point of contact for people looking for help. Plus they're a wealth of knowledge when it comes to your research institutes and who has a lot of complicated data|
